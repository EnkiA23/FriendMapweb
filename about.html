    <h1>About FriendMap</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Our mission</h2>
      <p>FriendMap exists to help you stay connected with the people who matter. We believe location sharing should be simple, optional, and in your control – so you can meet up easily, drive together safely, and discover places without losing track of each other.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>FriendMap is a cross-platform app that lets you share your location in real time with friends you choose. You can see each other on the map, navigate to meet, drive in convoys with turn-by-turn and optional voice, create events and invite friends, and use AR tagging to leave and find real-world markers. We focus on clarity, privacy, and ease of use so you spend less time coordinating and more time together.</p>

      <h2>Who it’s for</h2>
      <p>FriendMap is for anyone who wants to coordinate with friends and family – road trips, meet-ups, events, or just knowing when someone is on the way. We build for both casual hangouts and planned get-togethers, with features like parent approval and clear privacy controls so the app can fit different needs.</p>

      <h2>Safety first</h2>
      <p><strong>SOS & emergency:</strong> The app includes an SOS feature so you can quickly trigger an in-app alarm, call 911, call a trusted contact, or send your live location via SMS. For users 15 and under, the trusted contact is the parent or guardian.</p>
      <p><strong>Age verification:</strong> If you’re 15 or under, we require a parent or guardian to verify the account (including identity verification) before you can use FriendMap. The app stays locked until verification is complete, so teens stay safe while still being able to use the app with permission.</p>
