    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [Add date]. By using FriendMap, you agree to these terms.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
      <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) apply to your use of the FriendMap application and related services. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Description of service</h2>
      <p>FriendMap provides location sharing, convoy, event, and AR tagging features so you can coordinate with friends. We may change, suspend, or discontinue features with reasonable notice where practicable.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Account and eligibility</h2>
      <p>You must provide accurate information and keep your account secure. You must be old enough to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction (or have parent/guardian consent where we require it). You are responsible for all activity under your account.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the app for any illegal purpose or in violation of any laws.</li>
        <li>Harass, abuse, stalk, or threaten others or share location to harm anyone.</li>
        <li>Impersonate others or create false accounts.</li>
        <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems, other users’ accounts, or third-party services.</li>
        <li>Reverse engineer, scrape, or automate access to the app in ways we do not permit.</li>
        <li>Use the app in a way that could harm, overload, or impair the service or others’ use.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Location and safety</h2>
      <p>You use location sharing at your own risk. You are responsible for whom you share location with and for your own safety. Do not rely solely on the app for emergency or critical safety decisions. In an emergency, contact local emergency services.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>FriendMap and its content, branding, and technology are owned by us or our licensors. You may not copy, modify, or create derivative works from the app except as allowed by these Terms or with our written permission. See our <a href="copyright.html">Copyright</a> page for more information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Privacy</h2>
      <p>Your use of the app is also governed by our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. By using FriendMap, you consent to the collection and use of information as described there.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>The app is provided “as is.” We do not warrant that it will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components. Location and map data may be inaccurate or delayed. We disclaim all warranties to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we (and our affiliates, directors, and employees) are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for loss of data, revenue, or profits, arising from your use of the app. Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the twelve months before the claim (or CAD $100 if you paid nothing).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>10. Indemnity</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the app, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any third-party rights.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>11. Changes to terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms. We will post the revised Terms in the app or on this website and indicate the effective date. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the app.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>12. General</h2>
      <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the app. If any part is held unenforceable, the rest remains in effect. Our failure to enforce a right does not waive that right. For questions, see the contact information on our <a href="copyright.html">Copyright</a> page.</p>
