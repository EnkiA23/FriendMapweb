    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [Add date]. Please read this policy carefully.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>FriendMap (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) is a location-sharing application. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it. By using FriendMap, you agree to this policy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. We do not sell your data – and we don’t keep it for ads</h2>
      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data to anyone. We do <strong>not</strong> use your data for advertising or to build ad profiles like many other apps. We only use your information to run the app and provide the features you use (location sharing, convoys, events, SOS, etc.).</p>
      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> keep your data longer than necessary. We retain only what we need to provide the service, comply with the law, and protect safety (e.g. age verification for minors). When you delete your account, we delete or anonymize your data as described in the Data retention section below.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. How we make money</h2>
      <p>FriendMap is funded through <strong>donations</strong> and <strong>optional subscription membership</strong> – not by selling your data or showing you targeted ads. We may offer premium features or support tiers in the future; your privacy will never be traded for revenue.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Information we collect</h2>
      <p>We may collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account information:</strong> Phone number (for sign-in), display name, and profile photo if you provide them.</li>
        <li><strong>Location data:</strong> When you enable location sharing, we process your device’s location to show it to friends you have chosen. Location is shared only according to your settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Information about how you use the app (e.g. features used, convoys or events created) to operate and improve the service.</li>
        <li><strong>Device information:</strong> Device type, operating system, and app version for compatibility and support.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. How we use your information</h2>
      <p>We use the information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide location sharing, convoys, events, AR tagging, and related features.</li>
        <li>Authenticate you (e.g. via phone verification) and manage your account.</li>
        <li>Send you notifications you have agreed to (e.g. friend requests, event reminders, convoy updates).</li>
        <li>Operate, secure, and improve the app and our systems.</li>
        <li>Comply with applicable law and enforce our terms.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Sharing and disclosure</h2>
      <p>Your location and profile are shared only with the friends or participants you select within the app. We do not sell your personal data. We may share data with service providers that help us run the app (e.g. hosting, authentication, maps, push notifications) under strict obligations. We may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights and safety.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Third-party services</h2>
      <p>FriendMap uses third-party services that may process your data, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Firebase (authentication, database, storage, push notifications).</li>
        <li>HERE (maps, routing, location).</li>
        <li>Other providers for analytics or support where applicable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each provider has its own privacy policy. We encourage you to review them.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Data retention and your choices</h2>
      <p>We do not keep your data longer than necessary. We retain it only while your account is active and as needed to provide the service, comply with law, or protect safety (e.g. age verification records where required). When you delete your account, we delete or anonymize your personal data. You can turn off location sharing at any time, delete content, or delete your account. To request access, correction, or deletion of your data, contact us using the details on our <a href="copyright.html">Copyright</a> page.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. Security</h2>
      <p>We use industry-standard measures to protect your data (e.g. encryption, access controls). No system is completely secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>10. Children, age verification, and parent approval</h2>
      <p>Users who are <strong>15 years old or under</strong> are treated as minors. They must have a parent or guardian verify the account before they can use FriendMap. We collect date of birth during profile setup; for minors we also collect the parent’s email (and optionally phone) and require the parent to complete identity verification (e.g. government ID) before we approve the account. The app remains blocked for the minor until the parent’s verification is approved. We do not use this information for marketing or ads; it is used only for safety, compliance, and operating the service. Parents can contact us to review or delete a child’s information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>11. SOS and emergency data</h2>
      <p>When you use the SOS feature (in-app alarm, call 911, call trusted contact, or send your location via SMS), we use your current location only to build the message or link you send. We do not store or sell SOS-related location or contact data for advertising or profiling. For minors, the trusted contact is the parent or guardian on file. For adults, you can set an optional trusted contact in Settings; we store that only to support the SOS feature.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>12. Changes</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. We will post the revised policy in the app or on this website and indicate the effective date. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>
    </section>
